##SCRUM
To my mind one of the the main threads in starting of scrum is the thread of falling to the Cargo cult, when a team start to do activities but doesn't understand what are this activities for

What are the prerequisites for SCRUM process in a company:
-Discipline
-Communication
-High quality of product management


##eXtreme PM

exploratory nature

high risk, high change

Heavy client involvement

no time constraints!
can add side business value.

high level documentation but massive communication

establish rules for change requests then quickly react on changes


weaknesses 
easy to head of the road

###IN SP I RE model


##Multiple Teams Projects
Several independent team (possible from outside)
MY: crucial task to organize communication channels and interfaces between teams

Project Office Structure
linear and incremental processes

Core Team Structure 
Core Team Manager is not a Project Manager
He is a Lead of Leads

##Project Management Life Cycles

A **project management life cycle (PMLC)** is a sequence
of processes that includes:
* Scoping
* Planning
* Launching
* Monitoring and controlling
* Closing

We choose approach basing on level of goals clearness. 

<em>I'm still have a general questions, 
How to describe Business values? How to make constrains? The business can say.. we want to get 10 or 100 or 1000 customers... let us make a project to do it. __How to separate groundless wishes from reasonable goals?__ 

Or maybe better formulation of the question is: __How to separate business goals from project goals?__
Achieve business goals is a project? Or project is to get business value (make revenue generator) which helps to achieve business goal? 
</em>

The more uncertaincy we get the less detailed planning for the whole project we need in the beginning. It doesn't mean that we need less planning, 

###Traditional Project Management
20% of projects. Infrastructure projects. 
TPM projects are change-intolerant. RBS and WBS are relatively complete. High expenses for change.
Well-known technology. Skilled and well organized team. Well known risks. 

Linear PMLC model.

[WysockiFig22]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-2.png "Lenear PMLC Model"
There is no going back to improve deliverables.

Incremental PMLC model. 
 The complete solution is known at the outset

Differences from Linear.
*Deliverables in the Incremental approach are released according to a
schedule.
* Encourages change requests.
* Often extensive re-planning follows, significantly changing the release schedule.

###Agile Project Management
The vast majority of their projects are a closer fit to APM approaches than either TPM or xPM approaches
Examples:
* A Critical Problem without a Known Solution
* A Previously Untapped Business Opportunity

APM projects are change-driven. APM are “lean” in terms of planning resources. They utilize just-in-time planning models.
