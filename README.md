##SCRUM
To my mind one of the the main threads in starting of scrum is the thread of falling to the Cargo cult, when a team start to do activities but doesn't understand what are this activities for

What are the prerequisites for SCRUM process in a company:
-Discipline
-Communication
-High quality of product management


##eXtreme PM

exploratory nature

high risk, high change

Heavy client involvement

no time constraints!
can add side business value.

high level documentation but massive communication

establish rules for change requests then quickly react on changes


weaknesses 
easy to head of the road

###IN SP I RE model


##Multiple Teams Projects
Several independent team (possible from outside)
MY: crucial task to organize communication channels and interfaces between teams

Project Office Structure
linear and incremental processes

Core Team Structure 
Core Team Manager is not a Project Manager
He is a Lead of Leads

##Project Management Life Cycles

A **project management life cycle (PMLC)** is a sequence
of processes that includes:
* Scoping
* Planning
* Launching
* Monitoring and controlling
* Closing

We choose approach basing on level of goals clearness. 

<em>I'm still have a general questions, 
How to describe Business values? How to make constrains? The business can say.. we want to get 10 or 100 or 1000 customers... let us make a project to do it. __How to separate groundless wishes from reasonable goals?__ 

Or maybe better formulation of the question is: __How to separate business goals from project goals?__
Achieve business goals is a project? Or project is to get business value (make revenue generator) which helps to achieve business goal? 
</em>

The more uncertaincy we get the less detailed planning for the whole project we need in the beginning. It doesn't mean that we need less planning, 

### PMLC model pie
At least 70 percent of all their projects are APM projects, 20 percent are TPM projects, and the remaining 10 percent is split between xPM and MPx projects

###Traditional Project Management
20% of projects. Infrastructure projects. 
TPM projects are change-intolerant. RBS and WBS are relatively complete. High expenses for change.
Well-known technology. Skilled and well organized team. Well known risks. 

_Linear PMLC model._ 
![fig22][WysockiFig22]
[WysockiFig22]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-2.png "Lenear PMLC Model"
There is no going back to improve deliverables.

_Incremental PMLC model._ 
 The complete solution is known at the outset
![fig23][WysockiFig23]
[WysockiFig23]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-3.png "Incremental PMLC Model"

Differences from Linear.
*Deliverables in the Incremental approach are released according to a
schedule.
* Encourages change requests.
* Often extensive re-planning follows, significantly changing the release schedule.

###Agile Project Management
The vast majority of their projects are a closer fit to APM approaches than either TPM or xPM approaches
Examples:
* A Critical Problem without a Known Solution
* A Previously Untapped Business Opportunity

APM projects are change-driven. APM are “lean” in terms of planning resources. They utilize just-in-time planning models.
The solution will be discovered only if the client and the development team meaningfully collaborate in an open and honest environment.
APM approaches do not scale well. To manage a 30+ project team, partition it into smaller teams, with each of these teams being responsible for part of the scope

APM approaches all have one thing in common — you cannot build a complete WBS without guessing. The choice
of which model to use depends somewhat on the initial degree of uncertainty you have about the solution.

_Iterative PLMC Model_
![fig24][WysockiFig24]
[WysockiFig24]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-4.png "Iterative PMLC Model"

Differs from the Incremental PMLC model in that change is expected. The development team usually takes client input and presents alternatives in the next version of the prototype.

_Adaptive PLMC Model_
the less you know about the solution, the more likely you will choose
an Adaptive PMLC model over an Iterative PMLC model.

![fig25][WysockiFig25]
[WysockiFig25]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-5.png "Adaptive PMLC Model"

###Extreme Project Management
Pure R & D, new product development, and process improvement projects
Example: Building a business-to-business (B2B) website with no further specification.

In most cases, there is no fixed budget or time line. Obviously, the client wants it completed ASAP for as little as possible.

__The xPM Project Is Very High Risk__

_We need to clarify the goal. For this we can use Probative Swim Lanes approach. Depending on available resources we probes can be performed concurrently or sequentially._

The goal is often not much more than a guess at a desired end state with the hope that a solution to achieve it can be found

Difference between APM and xPM PMLC. 
* In an APM project, scope is done once at the beginning of the project. In the xPM project, scope is adjusted at each phase.
* In many xPM projects, the client
takes a leadership position instead of the collaborative position they took in
APM projects.


_Extreme PLMC Model_
“Fuzzy goals” or goals that cannot be defined because of the exploratory nature of the extreme project
Example: Drug research

![fig26][WysockiFig26]
[WysockiFig26]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-6.png "Extreme PMLC Model"

xPM requires the client to be more involved within and between phases.

###Emertxe Project Management 
The solution is known, but the goal is not. Type of R & D project but in reverse. You hope to find a business value for application of your solution. The scheme is similar to xPM

MPx characteristics
* A New Technology without a Known Application
* A Solution Out Looking for a Problem to Solve (New software system introduced and you try to find how it can be useful to your company)

###Choosing a model 
![fig28][WysockiFig28]
[WysockiFig28]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-8.png "PMLC model choice process"

Other factors that can affect:
* Total Cost
* Duration
* Market Stability
* Technology
* Business climate
* Number of departments affected
* Organizational Environment
* Team Skills
TPM - "B" players (or even "C")
APM -  "B" players with supervision of "A" player often sufficient
The less you know about the solution, the more you are going to have to staff your project with “A” players


## Project Management Process Groups
* _Scoping Process Group_ (which PMI calls the Initiating Process Group)
“What business situation is being addressed?” and “What does the business
need to do?”
* _Planning Process Group_
* _Launching Process Group (which PMI calls the Executing Process Group)_
* _Monitoring and Controlling Process Group_
* _Closing Process Group_

### Knowledge Areas
Project Integration Management
Project Scope Management
Project Time Management
Project Cost Management
Project Quality Management
Project Human Resource Management
_Project Communications Management_
As many as 70 percent of the IS/IT project failures can be traced back to poor communications
A good communications management process will have provisions in the process that answer the following questions:
* Who are the project stakeholders?
* What do they need to know about the project?
   Common questions of all stakeholders:
  * What input will I be required to provide the project team?
  * How can I make my needs known?
  * When will the project be done?
  * How will it affect me?
  * Will I be replaced?
  * How will I learn how to use the deliverables?
* How should their needs be met?

Project Risk Management
Project Procurement Management
_Project Stakeholder Management_
Stakeholder types:
* Sponsors
* Clients
* Customers
* Business process engineers
* Resource managers
* Project managers
* Business analysts

[WysockiTab33]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-tab-3-3.png "Mapping of the Ten Knowledge Areas to the Five Process Groups"

The Process Groups are the building blocks of project management methodologies. Similarly,
by selecting and adapting the processes within a Process Group, you can establish the specific processes that drive a PMLC. So the processes within a Process Group are the detailed building blocks of the phases of the PMLC.

###Ch4
Managing Client Expectations
Wants versus Needs
__Wants and needs are closely linked to one another but are fundamentally
different__ Client wants tend to be associated with a solution
to a problem that they envision. Needs tend to be associated with the actual
problem. __Ask the client why they want what they want__

![fig44][WysockiFig44]
[WysockiFig44]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-4-4.png "The Stakeholder Interaction Model"


__Selected Methods for Eliciting Requirements from Business Needs__
| METHOD | STRENGTHS | RISKS |
|----| --------------------| -------------|
|Facilitated Group Sessions  | Excellent for cross-functional processes.Detailed requirements can be documented and verified immediately. Resolves issues with an impartial facilitator. | Use of untrained facilitators can lead to a negative response from users. The time and cost of the planning and/or executing session can be high.|
|Interviews |End-user participation. High-level descriptions of functions and processes are provided.  |Descriptions may differ from actual detailed activities. Without structure, stakeholders may not know what information to provide. Real needs may be ignored if the analyst is prejudiced.|
|Prototyping  |Innovative ideas can be generated. Users clarify what they want. Users identify requirements that may be missed.Client-focused. Early proof of concept.Stimulates thought processes. |Client may want to implement the prototype. Difficult to know when to stop. Specialized skills are required. Absence of documentation. |
|Requirements Workshop |Good way for first-time users. |May overwhelm customer. |

__Project Overview Statement (POS)__
The POS is a short document (ideally one page) that concisely states what is to be done in the project, why it is to be done, and what business value it will provide to the enterprise when completed.

The POS has the following five component parts:
* Problem or opportunity
* Project goal
   __Specific__ — Be specifi c in targeting an objective.
   __Measurable__ — Establish measurable indicators of progress.
   __Assignable__ — Make the object assignable to one person for completion.
   __Realistic__ — State what can realistically be done with available resources.
   __Time-related__ — State when the objective can be achieved—that is, the duration.
* Project objectives
* Success criteria
* Assumptions, risks, and obstacles
