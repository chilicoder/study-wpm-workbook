##SCRUM
To my mind one of the the main threads in starting of scrum is the thread of falling to the Cargo cult, when a team start to do activities but doesn't understand what are this activities for

What are the prerequisites for SCRUM process in a company:
-Discipline
-Communication
-High quality of product management


##eXtreme PM

exploratory nature

high risk, high change

Heavy client involvement

no time constraints!
can add side business value.

high level documentation but massive communication

establish rules for change requests then quickly react on changes


weaknesses 
easy to head of the road

###IN SP I RE model


##Multiple Teams Projects
Several independent team (possible from outside)
MY: crucial task to organize communication channels and interfaces between teams

Project Office Structure
linear and incremental processes

Core Team Structure 
Core Team Manager is not a Project Manager
He is a Lead of Leads

##Project Management Life Cycles

A **project management life cycle (PMLC)** is a sequence
of processes that includes:
* Scoping
* Planning
* Launching
* Monitoring and controlling
* Closing

![fig21][WysockiFig21]
[WysockiFig21]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-1.png "PML approaches"
We choose approach basing on level of goals clearness. 

<em>I'm still have a general questions, 
How to describe Business values? How to make constrains? The business can say.. we want to get 10 or 100 or 1000 customers... let us make a project to do it. __How to separate groundless wishes from reasonable goals?__ 

Or maybe better formulation of the question is: __How to separate business goals from project goals?__
Achieve business goals is a project? Or project is to get business value (make revenue generator) which helps to achieve business goal? 
</em>

The more uncertaincy we get the less detailed planning for the whole project we need in the beginning. It doesn't mean that we need less planning, 

### PMLC model pie
At least 70 percent of all their projects are APM projects, 20 percent are TPM projects, and the remaining 10 percent is split between xPM and MPx projects

###Traditional Project Management
20% of projects. Infrastructure projects. 
TPM projects are change-intolerant. RBS and WBS are relatively complete. High expenses for change.
Well-known technology. Skilled and well organized team. Well known risks. 

_Linear PMLC model._ 
![fig22][WysockiFig22]
[WysockiFig22]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-2.png "Lenear PMLC Model"
There is no going back to improve deliverables.

_Incremental PMLC model._ 
 The complete solution is known at the outset
![fig23][WysockiFig23]
[WysockiFig23]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-3.png "Incremental PMLC Model"

Differences from Linear.
*Deliverables in the Incremental approach are released according to a
schedule.
* Encourages change requests.
* Often extensive re-planning follows, significantly changing the release schedule.

###Agile Project Management
The vast majority of their projects are a closer fit to APM approaches than either TPM or xPM approaches
Examples:
* A Critical Problem without a Known Solution
* A Previously Untapped Business Opportunity

APM projects are change-driven. APM are “lean” in terms of planning resources. They utilize just-in-time planning models.
The solution will be discovered only if the client and the development team meaningfully collaborate in an open and honest environment.
APM approaches do not scale well. To manage a 30+ project team, partition it into smaller teams, with each of these teams being responsible for part of the scope

APM approaches all have one thing in common — you cannot build a complete WBS without guessing. The choice
of which model to use depends somewhat on the initial degree of uncertainty you have about the solution.

_Iterative PLMC Model_
![fig24][WysockiFig24]
[WysockiFig24]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-4.png "Iterative PMLC Model"

Differs from the Incremental PMLC model in that change is expected. The development team usually takes client input and presents alternatives in the next version of the prototype.

_Adaptive PLMC Model_
the less you know about the solution, the more likely you will choose
an Adaptive PMLC model over an Iterative PMLC model.

![fig25][WysockiFig25]
[WysockiFig25]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-5.png "Adaptive PMLC Model"

###Extreme Project Management
Pure R & D, new product development, and process improvement projects
Example: Building a business-to-business (B2B) website with no further specification.

In most cases, there is no fixed budget or time line. Obviously, the client wants it completed ASAP for as little as possible.

__The xPM Project Is Very High Risk__

_We need to clarify the goal. For this we can use Probative Swim Lanes approach. Depending on available resources we probes can be performed concurrently or sequentially._

The goal is often not much more than a guess at a desired end state with the hope that a solution to achieve it can be found

Difference between APM and xPM PMLC. 
* In an APM project, scope is done once at the beginning of the project. In the xPM project, scope is adjusted at each phase.
* In many xPM projects, the client
takes a leadership position instead of the collaborative position they took in
APM projects.


_Extreme PLMC Model_
“Fuzzy goals” or goals that cannot be defined because of the exploratory nature of the extreme project
Example: Drug research

![fig26][WysockiFig26]
[WysockiFig26]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-6.png "Extreme PMLC Model"

xPM requires the client to be more involved within and between phases.

###Emertxe Project Management 
The solution is known, but the goal is not. Type of R & D project but in reverse. You hope to find a business value for application of your solution. The scheme is similar to xPM

MPx characteristics
* A New Technology without a Known Application
* A Solution Out Looking for a Problem to Solve (New software system introduced and you try to find how it can be useful to your company)

###Choosing a model 
![fig28][WysockiFig28]
[WysockiFig28]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-2-8.png "PMLC model choice process"

Other factors that can affect:
* Total Cost
* Duration
* Market Stability
* Technology
* Business climate
* Number of departments affected
* Organizational Environment
* Team Skills
TPM - "B" players (or even "C")
APM -  "B" players with supervision of "A" player often sufficient
The less you know about the solution, the more you are going to have to staff your project with “A” players


## Project Management Process Groups
* _Scoping Process Group_ (which PMI calls the Initiating Process Group)
“What business situation is being addressed?” and “What does the business
need to do?”
* _Planning Process Group_
* _Launching Process Group (which PMI calls the Executing Process Group)_
* _Monitoring and Controlling Process Group_
* _Closing Process Group_

### Knowledge Areas
Project Integration Management
Project Scope Management
Project Time Management
Project Cost Management
Project Quality Management
Project Human Resource Management
_Project Communications Management_
As many as 70 percent of the IS/IT project failures can be traced back to poor communications
A good communications management process will have provisions in the process that answer the following questions:
* Who are the project stakeholders?
* What do they need to know about the project?
   Common questions of all stakeholders:
  * What input will I be required to provide the project team?
  * How can I make my needs known?
  * When will the project be done?
  * How will it affect me?
  * Will I be replaced?
  * How will I learn how to use the deliverables?
* How should their needs be met?

Project Risk Management
Project Procurement Management
_Project Stakeholder Management_
Stakeholder types:
* Sponsors
* Clients
* Customers
* Business process engineers
* Resource managers
* Project managers
* Business analysts

![tab33][WysockiTab33]
[WysockiTab33]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-tab-3-3.png "Mapping of the Ten Knowledge Areas to the Five Process Groups"

The Process Groups are the building blocks of project management methodologies. Similarly,
by selecting and adapting the processes within a Process Group, you can establish the specific processes that drive a PMLC. So the processes within a Process Group are the detailed building blocks of the phases of the PMLC.

###Ch4 Scoping in TPM
Managing Client Expectations
Wants versus Needs
__Wants and needs are closely linked to one another but are fundamentally
different__ Client wants tend to be associated with a solution
to a problem that they envision. Needs tend to be associated with the actual
problem. __Ask the client why they want what they want__

![fig44][WysockiFig44]
[WysockiFig44]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-4-4.png "The Stakeholder Interaction Model"


__Selected Methods for Eliciting Requirements from Business Needs__
| METHOD | STRENGTHS | RISKS |
|----| --------------------| -------------|
|Facilitated Group Sessions  | Excellent for cross-functional processes.Detailed requirements can be documented and verified immediately. Resolves issues with an impartial facilitator. | Use of untrained facilitators can lead to a negative response from users. The time and cost of the planning and/or executing session can be high.|
|Interviews |End-user participation. High-level descriptions of functions and processes are provided.  |Descriptions may differ from actual detailed activities. Without structure, stakeholders may not know what information to provide. Real needs may be ignored if the analyst is prejudiced.|
|Prototyping  |Innovative ideas can be generated. Users clarify what they want. Users identify requirements that may be missed.Client-focused. Early proof of concept.Stimulates thought processes. |Client may want to implement the prototype. Difficult to know when to stop. Specialized skills are required. Absence of documentation. |
|Requirements Workshop |Good way for first-time users. |May overwhelm customer. |

[WysockiTab42]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-tab-4-2.png "Mapping of the Ten Knowledge Areas to the Five Process Groups"

__Project Overview Statement (POS)__
The POS is a short document (ideally one page) that concisely states what is to be done in the project, why it is to be done, and what business value it will provide to the enterprise when completed.

The POS has the following five component parts:
* Problem or opportunity
* Project goal
   __Specific__ Be specific in targeting an objective.
   __Measurable__ Establish measurable indicators of progress.
   __Assignable__ Make the object assignable to one person for completion.
   __Realistic__ State what can realistically be done with available resources.
   __Time-related__ State when the objective can be achieved - that is, the duration.
* Project objectives
* Success criteria
* Assumptions, risks, and obstacles

##Planning in TPM
![fig51][WysockiFig51]
[WysockiFig51]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-5-1.png "Pain curves"

Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) chart is a graphical tool
that displays the relationship between dependent tasks

As for project planning the list is very short: sticky notes, marking pens, and plenty of whiteboard space. The tools I just mentioned happen to be my choice for some incremental, most iterative, all adaptive, and all extreme projects. Just remember that if you create the plan using software tools, you have to maintain it using the software tools.

The following estimates of planning time are a good guide:
  Very small projects Less than 1/2 day
  Small projects Less than one day
  Medium projects 2 days
  Large projects 3 – 4 days
  Very large projects 30 team members translates to a large project. The planning time can vary widely from 5 or more days to several months.

The objective of a Joint Project Planning Session (JPPS) is this: Develop a project plan that meets the COS as negotiated between the requester and the provider, and as described in the POS and RBS. (Conditions of Satisfaction (COS) and Project Overview Statement (POS))

Sample agenda for the project planning sessions:
* Session 1
  1. Negotiate the COS.
  2. Build the RBS.
* Session 2
  1. Write the POS.
* Session 3 (JPPS)
  1. The entire planning team creates the first-level WBS.
  2. Subject matter experts develop further decomposition, with the entire planning team observing and commenting.
  3. Estimate activity durations and resource requirements.
  4. Construct a project network diagram.
  5. Determine the critical path.
  6. Revise and approve the project completion date.
  7. Finalize the resource schedule.
  8. Gain consensus on the project plan.

The __Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)__ is a hierarchical description of all work that must be done to complete the project as
defined in the current RBS

Six Criteria to Test for Completeness in the WBS
Activity must possess to be called a task are as follows:
* Status and completion are measurable.
* The activity is bounded.
* The activity has a deliverable.
* Time and cost are easily estimated.
* Activity duration is within acceptable limits.
* Work assignments are independent.

If the activity does not possess all six of these characteristics, decompose the activity and check it again at that next lower level of decomposition.

Approaches to Building the WBS
* Physical Decomposition
* Functional Decomposition
* Design-Build-Test-Implement
* Objectives
* Geographic
* Departmental
* Business Process
pick the one that seems to bring the most clarity to defining the project work.

Estimating.
It is important to understand the difference between labor time and duration time. They are not the same.

Project Network Diagram
A project schedule can be built using either of the following:
* Gantt chart
* Network diagram

* Executive Summary
* Background
* Objective
* Overview of the Approach to Be Taken
* Detailed Statement of the Work
* Time and Cost Summary
* Appendices

###Launch a TPM Project
Recruiting the Project Team.
Building effective teams is as much an art as it is
a science.

The project team has the following three separate components:
* Core team
* Client team
* Contract team

The Project Kick-Off Meeting is the formal announcement to the organization that this project has been planned and approved for execution.

A sample Project Kick-off Meeting agenda:
* Introduce the sponsor to the project team
* Introduce the importance of the project by the sponsor
* Introduce the project (client)
* Introduce the project (project manager)
* Introduce the project team members to each other
* Write the PDS
* Establish the team operating rules
* Review the project plan
* Finalize the project schedule
* Write work package


Establishing Team Operating Rules.
Having these rules developed and agreed to by every team member is critical to project success. The rules of the engagement will help establish an environment for solving many project-related problems

Situations that Require Team Operating Rules:
* Problem solving
* Decision making
  * _Directive._ the person with the authority (the project manager for the project and the task manager for the task) makes the decision for all team members
  * _Participative._ Everyone on the team contributes to the decision-making process.
  * _Consultative._ The person in authority makes the final decision, but this decision is made only after consulting with all members to get their input and ideas
* Conflict resolution
  * _Avoidant_ Some people will do anything to avoid a direct confrontation, but each person’s input and opinion must be sought. A simple device is to ask all of the team members in turn what they think about the situation and what they suggest should be done about it.
  * _Combative_ The project manager must be able to identify these combative team members and act to mitigate the chances of these combative situations arising. Tip: to put potentially combative individuals in charge of forming a recommendation for the team to consider.
  * _Collaborative_ This approach encourages each team member to put his or her opinions on the table and not avoid any conflict that may result.
* Consensus building
* Brainstorming
* Team meetings

Team War Room
Ideally, all of the walls are covered with whiteboards. Depending on the size of the team, the team war room may be one large room that accommodates everyone or several smaller rooms that are adjacent to a larger community-type room for group meetings and presentations. These adjacent rooms can double as breakout rooms. Each team member has his or her own private workspace, but there is a minimum number of partitions. A line of sight between each team member is ideal. The project artifacts are displayed so everyone has immediate access.

Managing Scope Changes.
Change is a way of life in project management. You might as well confront it and be prepared to act accordingly. Think of it as a mini-JPPS.
![fig62][WysockiFig62]
[WysockiFig62]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-6-2.png "A typical change control process"

Managing Team Communications.
Technical people often simply aren't good communicators. However, for team members to be truly effective, they have to openly communicate with one another

Effectively managing communications is a critical factor for successful project
management.

About long documents. You would get more meaningful feedback by parceling out the document based on level of interest and involvement in the process, rather than asking everyone to read and comment on all 50 pages.

Managing Communications with the Sponsor.
Without sponsor involvement in all phases of the project, you will be in dire trouble. 
  1. The first action to take when you are about to start a project is to go to the sponsor and ask what they want to know and when they want to know it.
  2. A second consideration is to ensure that the sponsor gets information regularly. Status reports should be sent to the sponsor at least once a week

Assigning Resources.
Any organization that does not have a way of effectively handling these situations will find itself in a situation analogous to the fl ow through a funnel

![fig64][WysockiFig64]
[WysockiFig64]: https://github.com/chilicoder/study-wpm-workbook/blob/master/images/wisocki-fig-6-4.png "The resource scheduling problem"
Too many organizations believe that by simply adding more into the top of the funnel, more will come out of the bottom.
The resource schedule needs to be leveled for the following two reasons: 
* To ensure that no resource is over-allocated. That is, you do not schedule a resource to more than 100 percent of its available time.
* You, as the project manager, want the number of resources (people, in most cases) to follow a logical pattern throughout the life of the project

Approaches to level project resources:
* Utilizing available slack
* Shifting the project finish date
* Smoothing


Work Packages.
The __work package__ is a statement by each task manager as to how he or she plans
to complete the task within the scheduled start and finish dates.
