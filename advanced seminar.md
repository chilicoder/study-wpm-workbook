##20 Adaptive Hypermedia
_PETER BRUSILOVSKY_

__Adapting to what__

User data.
Goals/tasks, knowledge, background, and preferences were modeled and used for making adaptation decisions by many new systems.
User interests
User's individual traits is a group name for user features that together de¢ne a user as an individual.Examples are personality factors (e.g. introvert/extravert), cognitive factors, and learning styles.

*Moreover, several
experimental studies (which have aimed to evaluate the value of treating users with different individual traits differently) have concluded without ¢nding any signi¢cant differences. To progress in this area, we either need to learn more about the relation-ships between user traits and possible interface settings, or treat user traits as a blackbox and attempt to model them and adapt to them using non-symbolic technologies (Gilbert and Han, 1999).*

Usage data
Environment data
We distinguished two distinct areas of adaptation: content level adaptation or adaptive presentation and link level adaptation or adaptive navigation support.

__What can be adopted__
We distinguished two distinct areas
of adaptation: content level adaptation or adaptive presentation and link level adaptation or adaptive navigation support.

Modern adaptive hypermedia systems may have a choice of different types of media with which to present information to the user; that is, in addition to traditional text, we can also use music, video, speech, animation, and so on

Second, the rise of recommender systems makes it necessary to distinguish between two essentially different ways of adaptive navigation support: adapting the links that were present on a page at the time of hyperspace authoring, and generating new, non-authored links for a page.

* Handheld and mobile devices.

New technologies
Non-symbolic AI technologies.
Non-symbolic approaches are able to extract some information about the user from
the navigation trace as a whole

New Architectures
* Authoring tools.
* Component-based frameworks and user model servers
