##Presentation for 1st onsite
Social machines.
Beforhand the social aspect and technical aspect of life were separate but internet changed a lot. Nowadays we see configurations of people interacting with content and each other.
This brings into life notion of social machine where both aspects interwoven.

Assumptions of the Sociotechnical systems
1) The organisation is a system that functions as a coworking of people and technology
2) Organisation as a system is open to the environment. 

Main two components: social and technical

Its not possible to otimize only one aspect as the
System Theory (Bertalanffy)
the problem cant be resolved by traditional  scientific approach.
Its a top to bottom approach with focus on interaction.
It was strange in 30s but for now its a common adopted approach

3 views
- Functional view. As whole. Input and Output. State
- Structural view. Of which it consists and how they interconnected
- Hierarhical view. Decomposition of the system to subsystems and futher. 
Discusiion in the work of (peter…)

2 concepts. Information and Control.
Examples. Economic system. trafic system, ecosystem, weapon system, operating system, nerval system.

Properties of system
- borders. can be limited
- has a purpose (!)
- has a structure
- input output behabior
- parts have relationships

Nicolas Luhman applied system notion to socialogical science.

Social system constitutes itself through the communications
Ex. Nation, academic work, profecciaonal, sportmen etc. 

The system does cognition through the borders

Autopoises means that system have an ability to reshape them
and social systems can evolve out of itself. 

So social systems are different from technical systems (can evolve eg)
-Technichal are steered by surraundings.
-technical system are not developed by their own.
- can be static (social cant)

Work system. 
- Purpose of the system (!)

Actors perform to produce product to internal and external customers.

2 outcomes:
1) Delivered Products
2) Social and psychological consequences

The aim of sociotechnical system is to take both aspects and maximaze the outcom. 
(figure 1)

Social subsystem (members roles)
technical system (technology tasks)

Forms of social sysmems
-artificail aggregates (drivers)
-unorganized aggregates (audience, public transport)
-entities with patterns of relations (subcultures, fb friends)
-structured organizations

Social entities
- group
- team (have a task and responsibility one(in broader sence) for all members) 
- Social Network
- Community (with conventions, sense of membership rythm of interaction)
- formal organisation. A form of cooperation. concious, deliberate and purposeful (bernard)

Awareness in cooperation

cooperation is bound to the concept of a group.
- common task and common space/environment this physical co-presence must be substituted if people are not collocated now.
- 

Awareness is a prerequisite for coordinated action.
Group awareness is an understanding of the activities of others which provide a context to your own activities.

Balance between Privacy and Awareness.

Awareness is knowledge about the state of an enbironment.
Its never the task. its a context that allows you to make a task

Conflict resolution (!)


Chern

### Principle 1 Compatibility

Design is an arena for conflict
Design is not only for designers(!)
Such naive approaches as majority rule, horse trading or power plays are unaplicable.

Members must reach consensus

### P2 Minimal critical specification
Negative aspects states that only MVP should be required
Focus on what should be done, not on what should be done. Observation of people at their working pllaces shows how people violate rule in order to make job done.

### P3 Variance controle
### P4 Boundary location
### P5 Information Flow. 

Information in organization has 3 usages:
- For control 
- For record
- For action

### P6 Power and Authority
### P7 The Multifunctional Principle
Organisations need to adapt to their environments
Two ways: 
- adding new roles
- modifying old ones
### P8 Support Congruence
### P9 Transitional organisations
### P10 Incompletion or the Forth Bridge Principle

Emery-Thorsrud characteristics of a Good Job

mechanisms 
- resolving conflicts
- mainaining fairness of treatment
- generating and mainaining commitment of goals

#Second Phase

Leading Questions for the second phase of work[edit]

(OT1) Characterize the principles of Tayloristic labor organization!
- Focus on work methods, on maximum work specialization, and job break­ down;
- Separation of managerial and operational work; and
- The physical exclusion of all planning, governing, and controlling tasks from the manufacturing area.

Individuals are functional production factor. Recieves and performs tasks. 

Communications is limited only by hierarchy and roles of actors. Superiors sends orders to subordinates and get reports about job. Only through formal channels (orders, rules, tasks)

The system is a command-and-control type.

(OT2) What are the premises of success of Tayloristic labor organization?
• Products’ relatively long life cycles;
• Stable sales markets;
• Limited number of competitors with known strengths and weaknesses;
• Low­cost natural resources and low environmental burdens for firms
QUESTION: why is this a factor for success? 
• The general availability of highly motivated, well qualified or easily qualifiable workers.

THESIS: I believe, this qulification factor became even more crucial in modern organisations. Well organised team of qualified and motivated workers moving by small iterations and reflecting on their results can quickly identify errors in strategic vision and correct this errors. They even can come to completely different vision and strategy. People dominate Strategy in modern types of organisations. So, general availability of well qualified workers is more important for such organisations.  

Looks like this premises are the prerequisites for growth of large industries only. 

QUESTION: How about other forms of employment? 
E.g. Medical society is organised in traditional way, like they did hundred years ago. Learning society, also pretty traditional, although these days many new forms are created, we still have traditional Kindergarten - School -University model. And, not to forget, political systems are still very traditional. With current technical tools people can vote about their house or district decisions more often then once in four year. 

(OT3) How do modern forms of organization incorporate flexibility and capacity for innovation?

Decentralization and Modularization
Capabilities to adapt to market changes by:
• Reintegration of manufacturing and service functions into self­-contained and holistic processes that focus on customer value in respect of in the creation of business value
• Direct communication in new forms of work organization among all participants in a value­-creating process;
• Increasing employees’ capability to process market information, to inter­pret such information correctly, and to act in a customer­-oriented way;
• Nurturing employees’ capacity to recognize their organizational unit’s con­tribution to the total corporate value creation and market success, and to adjust their daily decisions accordingly;
• New roles for managers and employees in less hierarchic organizations.

*Technical and Non-technical Forms of Integration*
Future employee must have the capability to act within technical and non-­technical networks.
Employees have to develop qualifications with respect to the difficult field of communication. The increased deployment of networks has given rise to important questions regarding the creation of trust and the maintenance of interpersonal relations in a global working world. Cooperations also require new evaluation methods and tasks.

*New Forms of Human Resources Management*
The insights gained from the debate on the structure of work confirm that meaningful job con­tent, a manageable work environment, the quick feedback of work results, as well as adequate qualification, autonomy, and responsibility provide individuals with the possibility of self­-realization and, thus, increase their willingness to perform.

QUESTION: “The flattening or even eradication of hierarchical structures is necessary. Traditional departmentalization and hierarchical levels are no longer important.”
 Why are they no longer important? Structure means less frictions on finding out the responsobility, less resources on making a decision and stability for execution of the strategy. 
And what structures provide stability without traditional departments and hierarchies? How to make people not to spend all their time in getting to the point how they will get to the point?

(OT4) What are the characteristics of the property rights theory?
At the heart of the property rights theory lies the right to take action and the right of disposal (property rights), as well as their effects on the behavior of economic actors.
Property rights are the focal point of the property rights theory. Property rights have object­-related, as well as person­-related aspects. They determine the rights of an individual pertaining to the use of a good. By allocating property rights, transaction rights are created, but also obligations for those benefiting from such rights, as well as transaction restrictions for those who do not have property rights to the specific good.

Property rights associated with a good may be divided into four single rights
• The right to use a good (usus);
• The right to alter a good’s form and substance (abusus);
• The right to acquire gains arising from a good and the responsibility to assume any losses that may result (usus fructus);
• The right to sell a good to third parties (capitalization and / or liquidation rights).

Third central element of the property rights theory – transaction costs.

Actors’ willingness to act increases with the degree to which they can person­ ally acquire the benefits of their activities. This is of special impor­tance for research and development activities.

[fig28]

(OT5) What are the characteristics of the principle agent theory?
Principal ­agent relations are en­tered into when one party (principal) delegates decisions and implementation competencies to another party (agent). Agents make decisions that not only have an impact on their own welfare, but also influence their principals’ level of utility. The agent is the informed partner. 
The contract between the principal and agent is the central unit of analysis. 
Agency costs are the efficiency criterion. According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), these costs are comprised of three components:
• The principal’s monitoring and control costs;
• The agent’s signaling and guarantee costs;
• The remaining loss of welfare (residual loss).

Based on the underlying information asymmetry between the principal and agents, the classification of the focal principal-­agent relationship plays an impor­tant role. 
Three problem type:
• Hidden characteristics (Before contract risks);
The traditional example of this phenomenon is the used car market with Akerlof’s famous article on ‘Market of Lemons’ (Akerlof 1970), as potential buyers (principals) of used cars whose value are unknown, will start by assuming that they are of an average quality.
 To solve this problem, the principal­-agent theory of­fers two solutions: On the one hand, signaling, screening, as well as self­-selection contracts are mechanisms that reduce the information asymmetry between agent and principal
• Hidden action;
E.g when a supervisory board (principal), for example, cannot judge whether or not the board of directors’ (agent) chosen strategy was in the in­terests of the owners.
In order to limit the potential impact of moral hazard, the principal-­agent the­ory recommends monitoring to reduce information asymmetry (e.g., reporting systems and control mechanisms). Another alternative is the implementation of incentive systems (bonuses connected to results).

• Hidden intention.
After signing a contract, and based on this specific investment in the transaction, principals end up being dependent on agents, as they now have to rely on their ser­vices. 
Interest alignment through ownership of unique and retractable resources is rec­ommended to control the hold-up problem. Creation of mutual dependencies by requiring security in the form of collateral or “hostage taking”

Since the information asymmetries referred to above often surface simultaneously in business practice, in many cases, only a combination of various institutional forms of organization will provide an efficient solution.
[fig212]

(OT6) What are the main influnences of the Web on the organization of firms and markets?
Internationalization of markets
• Innovation dynamics in products and processes
• Buyer markets
• Globalization of purchases
• Demographic developments
• Resource scarcity
These changes are characterized by capacity, mobility, cooperative work, integration, openness, distribution, and globalization. With the help of these and other technologies, numerous new service markets have devel­ oped in related fields.

- Regional or national borders are of lesser importance
- no longer a clear differentiation between inside and outside.
- Capacity restrictions are eliminated due to the flexible integration of required resources.
- Knowledge boundaries can be extended and overcome more quickly
- Employees’ limited specialization and qualifications become less important 


(LT1) What is a learning theory?
Learning theory is a body of principles advocated by psychologists and educators to explain how people acquire skills, knowledge, and attitudes. Various branches of learning theory are used in formal training programs to improve and accelerate the learning process. Key concepts such as desired learning outcomes, objectives of the training, and depth of training also apply.


Traditional definition: learning defined as a change in behaviour. 
 Säljö (1979) research:
- Learning as a quantitative increase in knowledge. Learning is acquiring information or ‘knowing a lot’.
- Learning as memorising. Learning is storing information that can be reproduced.
- Learning as acquiring facts, skills, and methods that can be retained and used as necessary.
- Learning as making sense or abstracting meaning. Learning involves relating parts of the subject matter to each other and to the real world.
- Learning as interpreting and understanding reality in a different way. Learning involves comprehending the world by reinterpreting knowledge. (quoted in Ramsden 1992: 26)
1-3 - External perspective, Knowing what
4,5 - Internal one, knowing how

Knowledge and skill are different.

For orientations of the learning theory:
[fig-fourorientations]

(LT2) Characterize the behaviourist orientation to learning!
Behaviorism is a school of psychology that explains animal and human behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli.

three key assumptions:
- Observable behaviour rather than internal thought processes are the focus of study. In particular, learning is manifested by a change in behaviour.
- The environment shapes one’s behaviour; what one learns is determined by the elements in the environment, not by the individual learner.
- The principles of contiguity (how close in time two events must be for a bond to be formed) and reinforcement (any means of increasing the likelihood that an event will be repeated) are central to explaining the learning process. (Merriam and Caffarella 1991: 126)


According to James Hartley (1998) four key principles come to the fore:
- Activity is important. 
- Repetition, generalization and discrimination are important notions.
- Reinforcement is the cardinal motivator.
- Learning is helped when objectives are clear. 

(LT3) Characterize the cognitivist orientation to learning!
Cognitive theory focuses on what is going on inside the mind. It is more concerned with cognition (the process of thinking and learning)—knowing, perceiving, problem-solving, decision-making, awareness, and related intellectual activities—than with stimulus and response.

Jean Piaget, while recognizing the contribution of environment, explored changes in internal cognitive structure. He identified four stages of mental growth (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational and formal operational)

James Hartley (1998) has drawn out some of the key principles of learning associated with cognitive psychology:
- Instruction should be well-organized.
- Instruction should be clearly structured.
- The perceptual features of the task are important.
- Prior knowledge is important.
- Differences between individuals are important as they will affect learning.
- Cognitive feedback gives information to learners about their success or failure concerning the task at hand.

In the mid-1900s, a group of educators led by Benjamin Bloom tried to classify the levels of thinking behaviors thought to be important in the processes of learning.
[fig-raxonomyblooom]

(LT4) Characterize the humanist orientation to learning!
The center topic of this orientation is human growth and human potential for growth. 

Maslow’s hierachy of motivation:
[fig-maslow]
Criticism: Do lower needs really have to be satisfied before higher ones come into play? People may well put physiological needs on one side to satisfy the need for love, for example.

Carl Rogers stated that education engages the person entirely, for learning people combine the logic and intuition, the intellect and feelings
Elements of significant or experimental learning:
- It has a quality of personal involvement
- It is self-initiated. The sense of discovers of reaching out, of grasping and comprehending, comes from within.
- It is pervasive. Makes a difference in the behaviour, the attitudes, even the personality of the learner.
- It is evaluated by the learner.
- Its essence is meaning.

(LT5) Characterize the social/situational orientation to learning!
Social learning theory states that people learn from observing other people. Attending to a behaviour; remembering it as a possible model or paradigm; and playing out how it may work for them in different situations (rehearsal) are key aspects of observational learning.
Situated learning – has been put forward by Lave and Wenger (1991)
Initially people have to join communities and learn at the periphery. As they become more competent they move more to the ‘centre’ of the particular community. Learning is, thus, not seen as the acquisition of knowledge by individuals so much as a process of social participation. The nature of the situation impacts significantly on the process.

Claims
- no sense to talk of knowledge that is decontextualized
- learning are properly conceived as being located in communities of practice

Situated learning does provide three pointers for practice:
- Learning is in the relationships between people 
- Educators work so that people can become participants in communities of practice 
- There is an intimate connection between knowledge and activity 

(LT6) Characterize the foundations of learning according to Spector!
Two basic foundation areas: 
- what people do (psychology) 
There is much more to understand about human psychology and learning. As a consequence, models of instruction are likely to con- tinue to evolve based on our understanding of human behavior, cognition, and emotion.

- what people say 
(communications).
In short, language is fundamental to think- ing and learning.
Moreover, methods of communications are likely to influence learning outcomes and impact the design, deployment, and evaluation of instructional systems and performance environments.
It is worth mentioning one additional aspect of communications theory that is particularly pertinent to the world of digital media—namely, the notion of visualization as a form of communicating.

Human-Computer Interaction
Perhaps the most well known instructional theory that involves human–computer interaction is Merrill’s (1980) component display theory (CDT).

Instructional design and development
One of the more robust and well elaborated of these models in the four-component instructional design (4C/ID) model developed by van Merriënboer (1997).

(LT7) What are the types of hypertext being discussed by Niederhauser and their influence on learning?

- Hierarchical hypertext: A hypertext structure in which content is ordered relative to the concepts presented. The concepts presented on a screen link to superordinate (more general) concepts or subordinate (more specific) concepts.

- Linear hypertext: A hypertext structure in which links allow the reader to move forward and backward through the content, as if turning the pages of a book.

- Relational hypertext: A hypertext structure with links that allow the reader to access information on other screens that have some logical, conceptual, or hierarchical connection to the content on the current screen.

(LT8) Characterize some of the computer mediated technologies for learning as presented by Graesser et al.!
The learning strategies of most students are extremely limited, so the systems must provide modeling of effective strategies, intelligent scaffolding, and accurate feedback.

A broad landscape of 
learning technologies (T), 
pedagogical mechanisms (M),
learning goals (G), and 
learner characteristics (L)

Computer-mediated technologies:

- adaptive computer-based training, 
The learner 
(1) studies material presented in a lesson, 
(2) gets tested with a multiple choice test or another objective test, 
(3) gets feedback on the test performance, 
(4) restudies the material if the performance in step 2 is below threshold, and 
(5) progresses to a new topic if performance exceeds threshold

- dynamic multimedia, 
Material can be delivered in different presentation modes (verbal, pictorial), sensory modalities (auditory, visual), and delivery media (text, video, simulations).
Principles that predict when different forms of multimedia will facilitate learning:
- principles of modality, 
- coherence, 
- redundancy, and 
- individual differences.

- hypertext and hyper- media, 
These systems provide a large space of Web pages with texts, pictures, animations, and other media. Each page has hot spots for the learner to click and explore.

- interactive simulation, 
Interactive simulation allegedly produces more learning than having students simply view simulations. In interactive simulation, the student can actively control input parameters and observe the results on the system. The learner can slow down animations to inspect the process in detail, zoom in on important subcomponents of a system during the course of a simulation, observe the system from multiple viewpoints, and systematically relate inputs to outputs 

- intelligent tutoring systems, Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) track the knowl- edge states of learners in fine detail and adaptively respond with activities that are sensitive to these knowledge states. The processes of tracking knowl- edge (called user modeling) and adaptively responding to the learner.

- inquiry-based information retrieval, 
One type of inquiry learning consists of asking ques- tions and searching for answers in an information repository

- animated pedagogical agents, 
These agents speak, point, gesture, walk, and exhibit facial expressions. Some are built in the image of humans, whereas others are animals or cartoon characters.

- virtual environments with agents, 
Virtual environments are getting progressively closer to real-world settings and therefore should have excel- lent transfer to the real world but at costs that can be much more economical than learning in field settings. (Military field, flight simulations)
- serious games, and 
The challenge of combining entertainment and pedagogical content is the foundational question of serious games.

- collaborative learning environments
In computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), groups of learners collaboratively construct knowledge on a topic in pursuit of project goals that typically are provided by instructors 


(CT1)Explain the 3C Model for classification of CSCW Systems!
[fig-pres03]
Communication. Uni/Bi directional exchange of messages. And only. No atrefacts. 
Coordination. Smth that requires for jointly used resources. But people don’t have shared tasks.
Cooperation. People share common task. They have to work on joint atrefacts. They have success jointly. Its the scene for emotional conflict(!). Its an addition to rational communication with emotional aspect. 

(CT2) What is meant by Social Presence?
Possibility to play role in community. 
Its important because it influences on perception, appreciation and satisfaction in positive way. 

(CT3) Explain the Media Richness Model!
Task and Medium determines the success of communication task. 
[fig-pres01]

Media Richness Theory.
The richness should conform to the complexity of the communicational task
THESIS: That is why it is inefficient to blindly move techniques that works in offline cooperation to online cooperation. E.g. Scrum morning standups are not effective if done through skype/hangeout. Instead of getting shared rhythm and quickly and seamlessly sharing vision team often being annoyed by lacks in connections, and don’t feel each other. Same logic applicable to the retrospectives meetings, which are even more unpredictable in terms of agenda and critical to the rapport between each members. 
Richness characteristics.
- Senses 
- How long and how deep people know each other.
- How much people agreed upon points under discussion 
- How deep they involved into communication

(CT4) What are the main arguments by Gerry Stahl for his position, that in many areas of work collaborative information environments are needed?
- Learning—especially collaborative learning—has become a new form of labor, an integral component of work and organizations (Lave & Wenger, 1991).
- The pressure on individuals and groups to continually construct new knowledge out of massive sources of information strains the abilities of unaided human cognition. 
- The contemporary need to extend the learning process from schooling into organizational and community realms is known as lifelong learning.


(CT5) Explain the concept community of practice!
A group of persons, connected through a common craft.
E.g. Those who use one software tool, or share hobby etc. Something that is not related to the hierarchy of enterprise.

Communities of practice can be co-located within an organization (e.g., at our university) or across a discipline (e.g., all managers of university networks). Before the World Wide Web existed, most computer support for communities of practice targeted individuals with desktop applications.

Community memories are to communities of practice what human memories are to individuals. They embody organizational memory in external repositories that are accessible to community members.


(CT6) Why is the concept organizational learning important?
This reflective stage can be helped if designers have good community support and effective computer support to bring relevant new information to bear on their problem. When they have comprehended the problem and incorporated the new understanding in their personal memories, we say they have learned.
The articulated new knowledge can be shared within the community of practice. Such knowledge, created by the community, can be used in future situations to help a member overcome a breakdown in understanding.
The personal reflection and the collaborative articulation of shared perspectives interacting together make innovation possible
[fig52]

(CT7) Try to identify examples from your experience for the cycles of design (see Fig 5.2 in the book by Gerry Stahl)!
THESIS: “Rubber duck debugging”[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging] is technique based on a simplistic cycle of design. It assumes that if the developer explicitly articulates the problem to anyone, even who doesn’t know programming it allows to structure information and can provide insights for the solution.

(CT8) What are the main features in WebNet, that reflect the collaboration aspect?

The general problem for a CIE is to define analysis mechanisms that can bridge the gap from task representation to relevant community memory information items in order to support learning on demand 

Kay reviews the email to find out which routers are preferred by her colleagues.

Jay studies Kay’s design in his Web browser. He realizes that the Iris computer that Kay has added is powerful enough to perform the routing function itself.

Then he redefines the router critic rule in the simulation. He also sends Kay an email describing the advantages of doing the routing in software on the Iris; WebNet may make this email available to people in situations like Kay’s in the future.

In this scenario, Kay, Jay and Bea have used WebNet as a design, communication and memory system to support both their immediate tasks and the future work of their community. Knowledge has been constructed by people working on their own, but within a community context. Their knowledge has been integrated within a multi-component community memory that provides support for further knowledge building.


(CT9) What are the main arguments used by Larsson et al. for using lightweight technologies for information sharing in an engineering environment?

(CT10) What are he main problems identified by Grudin regarding the design and implementation of CSCW applications?

- The disparity between who does the work and who gets the benefit. The application fails because it requires that some people do additional work, while those people are not the ones who perceive a direct benefit from the use of the application.- The breakdown of intuitive decision-making. The design process fails because our intuitions are poor for multi-user applications -- decision-makers see the potential benefits for people similar to them- selves, but don’t see the implications of the fact that extra work will be required of others.- The underestimated difficulty of evaluating CSCW applications. We fail to learn from experience because these complex applications introduce almost insurmountable obstacles to meaningful, generalizable analysis and evaluation.
Evaluation of CSCW applications requires a very ‘different approach, based on the methodologies of social psychology and anthropology. This may not be news to those who have been monitoring the field of CSCW very closely, but the skills are largely absent in development and many research environments, where human factors engineers and cognitive psychologists are only starting to be accepted. And the required methods are generally more expensive, more time-consuming, and less precise


### Picot chapter 2

Two quite different theo­retical approaches: 
Neoclassical market equilibrium theory and 
Austrian market process theory.

Institutions are “... socially sanctionable expectations related to the actions and behaviors of one or more individuals”
information and communication are required to solve the coordination problem.
[fig21]


*Prisoners’ dilemma.*
Tit-for-tat.
By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.
- Nice 
- Retaliating
- Forgiving
- Non-envious (not striving to score more then opponent)
Southampton team strategy.


### Niederhauser. Educational Hypertext.
Three-stage process of text comprehension. The first two processes
— character/word decoding and 
- the construction of a textbase (a hierarchical proposi- tional representation of the textual information)
 are thought to be invariant across media. The third process, 
- creation of a situation model, is central to our under- standing of learning with hypertext.

Elements of hypertext in connection to learning.
- unique path- way through the text
- increased learner control 
- criss-crossing the conceptual landscape. the linked structure of hypertext allows the reader to access information from different paths

Menus, concept maps, and hotwords embedded in the text force the reader to choose his or her own path through the text.

Essential hypertext-specific variables include the effects of: 
(1) reader goals, several factors, including 
- implicit and explicit teacher/researcher goals
- features and informa- tion inherent in the hypertext
- learner goals 

(2) navigation patterns, 
six distinct strategies: 
- skimming, 
- checking, 
- reading, 
- responding, 
- studying, and 
- reviewing

support mechanisms that help users grasp the overall scope and structure of the content affects hypertext-assisted learning

Three navigational forms of the hypertext program: 
   (1) hierarchically structured content list, 
   (2) concept map, and 
   (3) embedded hyperlink.

(3) learner characteristics.
   - Prior Knowledge
   - Cognitive Style

(4) active cognitive engagement 
A fundamental shift in the reading process relates to the hypertext reader having to create his or her own path through the text. 



### Presentation 2
Organisation Theory
Discipline from economic. Theory about social part. Another part about learning theory. Theories behind learning. 

Organisation Theory 
Organisation comes when one person cant do one 

Workbreak and coordination. 

Coordination comprises two aspects
- Provision of information about tasks
- Motivation for the task

Motivation linked to organisation as an institution. Tha traditional view is - motivation as a hierarchical structure. Or it can be done throug the market. Job - Money. It is 2 extremes. nation as a enterprise… and all people are freelancers. 
(think about markets and taxes and how market work)

Intrinsically motivated.

How work can be organised if it split it several institutions. CSWS must understand the social system that underlyes!

Approaches of Organisation Theory

- traditioal. Taylorism. Focus on hierarchy. Break work in very small chunks and split to people. Assuming that there is one best organisation. Enironment is stable is another assumetion. (1856-1915). It is still an approach if product doesn’t change too much. Humans viewed as operators of machines and thats all.

- human-oriented approaches. Human in the center and take as much from them as possible. Quite opposite to Taylorism and hierarchy. (Ghoshal, Pfeffer and Staehle)

- system-oriented approach. System view on organisation.

- interinstitutional approaches.

[fig01] Determining appropriate organization form. 

Hierarchy - e.g. automobile. complex but brakeable. but the product has not much variations. 

Uncertain market - eg smartphones. like Apple who doesnt produce phones itself. One company builds interistitutional connections to other companies. Different parts has more autonomy. 

The more we go from tayloristic organisation more influence and importance of technology. 

### Learning theory. 

Dramatic changes over the 20th century. 
Modern Learning theory. These are ore or less cooperation systes. 
Requirement - decopling information bas and communication. 

Didactic triangle. learner - material - teacher. It forgets  about interaction between learners. And now it has more focus.

Colloboration between learners more focused todat

Evolution of Learning Theories. 
- Behaviorism  -> Teaching machines. Of his observable behavior. Train person to do things and do certain answers. e.g. Pilots. But Math can be teach like this (and other Theory stuff)

- Cognitivistic Approaches. start in 80s. Emotioanal part is out. We deal only with cognition. eg. Math. teach how to multiply. its not a mechanical. Intelligent Tutoring Systems tries to find what knowlege was missing while check students. 

- Situated Learning. It takes emotional part also in. It puts people in real project work situation (destealed of cause). Project based learning or Case based learning. 

sidenote: Consumer-oriented approach.

Its important not only analyse technical part but also to consider social part of the system.

### Designing Cooperation Systems
Important to understand the nature of organisation, roles
Problems usually not in technical level but in organisational aspect.

Understand in which way they cooperates. Roles, formal and informal, competancy. 

It is important to have the support of high management. The reason is that roles and interaction will change. Balance will change, so it is possible to introduce the system only with organisational change.

reseach paper Grudin(1989) old but still true. 
Reasons of failure:
1) Disparity between who does the work and who gets the benefits. Eg. knowledge system. Those who whats are whose who already know. 
2) Iterative decision making. That leads to people who make decision are not the users. 
Difficult to estimate CSCW to fit in your org. Better to do project.
3) The roles of system threatens the established structure. Informational role of the manager goes away. No manipulation. 

Social presence. 
Possibility to play role in community. 
Its important because it influences on perception, appreciation and satisfaction in positive way. 

Task and Medium determines the success of communication task. 
[fig-pres01]

Media Richness Theory.
The richness should conform to the complexity of the communicational task
THESIS: … about scrum by skype.
Richness characteristics.
-Sences 
-familiarity of peers?
- some other?

Design is not a programming or constructing new.  Its a combining of the components to fulfill the requiments. 

Cooperation in context of enterprise.
CSCW context

Classification of functions

Space-time classification
[fig-pres02]

3C classification 
[fig-pres03]
Communication. Uni/Bi directional exchange of messages. And only. No atrefacts. 
Coordination. Smth that requires for jointly used resources. But people don’t have shared tasks.
Cooperation. People share common task. They have to work on joint atrefacts. They have success jointly. Its the scene for emotional conflict(!). Its an addition to rational communication with emotional aspect. 

Group Editors.
It means, that it supports joint change of document
[fig-pres04]
Means of awareness. Who are here. Who does what and so on.
Challenges:
Consistency. In the end of the editing session you expect one outcome from all the contributors. But also possible to demand more or less strong sych in the process.
Frequency. How aware others should be what others are doing. More can feel better but distracts.
Roles. Translate or not roles to configuration of the system. Freedom vs Vandalism balance. 

Digital boards and tables. 
Shared context - means to focus the cooperation. Cooperation means that you have same context, same vision. 
Metaphor of Whiteboard is usual here. 
Challenge - the spontaneity of use. 

Information spaces. Storage for sharing information about coopetational work. 
Teamrooms, Confluence, Github, Wikis. 
-Available anytime anyplace. To newcommers. 
In many areas this is not a reality. The legislation system is an example. Conflict resolutions between new paragraphs and new are still not computer mediated. 
- stores history
- manages roles

Digital memory.
usefull to retrieve the reasons for decisions done. 
challange. how to get the access to get this information. 
Format, metadata, ontologies. 
If one would will think that everithing is saved. Then such unforgetable system can make people to act defensively. 

Typical functions in cooperational system
Use of Web 2.0 in topic of enterprise communication.
Web vs Web 2.0
Access to information -> Access and contribution to information.
Sowftware -> Services.
isolated information sources -> Meshups
(From Tim O’Reilly - What is Web 2.0)

Characteristics of Web 2.0
- focus on network instead of groups (network are loosely coupled)
- the data is the asset
- modularity
- usability matters. simplify 

Applying to enterprise
(Enterprise 2.0)
- Community of practice. A group of persons, connected through a common craft.
E.g. Those who use one software tool, or share hobby etc. Something that is not related to the hierarchy of enterprise.

In typical CSCW system we have a group in the center. And with web 2.0 Me becames a focus. Everibody contributes from their own.
Technologies. 
- Ajax
- Web services
- RSS and Atom
- Portal and meshup 

Origins of Social Software

CMS 80s
WikiWikiWeb 1995
Blogs 2000

Graph of SNS
If you come to Graghts you have a powerful tools. 
E.g. Tie strength. 
- frequency
- type 
- etc

Roles of Social Software
- Identitymanagement
- Communication
- Informationmanagement

Blogs can be a replacement to email
Analize opinions.

Microblogging
Wikis
Social Tagging Folksonomies.
