History 
In the Spring of 2000. Kent Beck invited a bunch of active XPers to discuss various issues in XP. He also invited a number of people who were interested but separate to XP: such as Alistair Cockburn, Jim Highsmith, and Dave Thomas.

During discussion they agreed there was a lot of common ground between XP and some of these other methods. As a result of this Bob Martin decided to try to put together a meeting of people interested in this broader range of methods.

In February 2001, 17 software developers and methodologists met at the Snowbird resort in Utah to discuss lightweight development methods.

Authors
Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened.




Values
Individuals and interactions are more important then processes and tools.
Focus on Working software but not on comprehensive documentation.
Appreciate Customer collaboration 
Positively Responding on changes.  Remember that plan is not a solid-rock monument"

Due to time constraints ill only enumerate them buton last slide you can find links on in depth explanations

Application
The 
Manifesto has been the guiding principle in all APM models, including those discussed in this book and marks the official beginning of the 
movement.


Some of connected methodologies:
Scrum
Adaptive Project Framework (APF)

Unified Process (AUP)
Dynamic systems development method (DSDM)
Extreme programming (XP)
Crystal Clear Methods


Adaptive software development (ASD)
Lean software development
Feature-driven development (FDD)
